Hereâ€™s a `README.md` file includes notes on running the project locally, especially if GitHub Codespaces doesn't support running `turtle` graphics directly.

# Snake Game

This is a simple Snake game built in Python using the `turtle` graphics library.

## How to Run the Game Locally

**Note:** The game may not run in GitHub Codespaces due to limited support for graphical libraries like `turtle`. To play the game, follow the steps below to set it up and run on your local machine.

### Requirements

- **Python 3.x** installed on your computer.
- The `turtle` graphics library (usually included in Python's standard library).
- Optionally, `tkinter` for graphical window support (also included in Python standard library).

### Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Dharmikkanani12/Python_projects/tree/main/The%20snake_game-Project
   ```
   Navigate into the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd snake-game
   ```

2. Ensure you have all required libraries. If running in a minimal environment, you may install dependencies using:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Running the Game

1. Open a terminal and navigate to the project folder.
2. Run the main script:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

### Controls

- Use the arrow keys (Up, Down, Left, Right) to control the direction of the snake.

### Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues with the `turtle` graphics not displaying:
- **Ensure you're running the script in a local environment** (e.g., your computer) rather than a cloud environment like GitHub Codespaces.
- **Check Python installation** to confirm `turtle` and `tkinter` are properly installed. They typically come with Python, but you may need to enable them in certain installations.
