"""The flowchart represents a decision-based game called "Treasure Island," where the objective is to find the treasure. Here is a detailed description of the decision-making process in the game:

1. **Start**: The game begins with the message "Welcome to Treasure Island. Your mission is to find the treasure."

2. **First Decision - Left or Right?**: The player must choose between going left or right.
   - **Right or anything else**: If the player chooses right or any other direction except left, they fall into a hole and the game is over ("Fall into a hole. Game Over.").
   - **Left**: If the player chooses left, they proceed to the next decision point.

3. **Second Decision - Swim or Wait?**: After choosing left, the player must decide whether to swim or wait.
   - **Swim or anything else**: If the player chooses to swim or anything other than wait, they are attacked by trout and the game is over ("Attacked by trout. Game Over.").
   - **Wait**: If the player chooses to wait, they move on to the next decision point.

4. **Third Decision - Which Door?**: After waiting, the player must choose between three doors: red, blue, or yellow.
   - **Red**: If the player chooses the red door, they are burned by fire and the game is over ("Burned by fire. Game Over.").
   - **Blue**: If the player chooses the blue door, they are eaten by beasts and the game is over ("Eaten by beasts. Game Over.").
   - **Yellow**: If the player chooses the yellow door, they find the treasure and win the game ("You Win!").
   - **Anything else**: If the player chooses any other door, the game is over without specifying a reason ("Game Over.").

The flowchart visually maps out these choices and their consequences, guiding the player through the game based on their decisions."""
