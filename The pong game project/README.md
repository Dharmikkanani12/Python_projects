# Pong Game

This is a simple Pong game built in Python using the `turtle` graphics library. The game includes paddles, a bouncing ball, and a scoreboard. Players can control their paddles using the keyboard to try to score against their opponent.

## How to Run the Game Locally

**Note:** The game may not run in GitHub Codespaces due to limited support for graphical libraries like `turtle`. To play the game, follow the steps below to set it up and run on your local machine.

### Requirements

- **Python 3.x** installed on your computer.
- The `turtle` graphics library (usually included in Python's standard library).
- Optionally, `tkinter` for graphical window support (also included in Python standard library).

### Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/pong-game.git

Navigate into the project directory:

cd pong-game

    Ensure you have all required libraries. If running in a minimal environment, you may install dependencies using:

    pip install -r requirements.txt

Running the Game

    Open a terminal and navigate to the project folder.
    Run the main script:

    python main.py

Controls

    Right Paddle: Use the "Up" and "Down" arrow keys.
    Left Paddle: Use the "w" and "s" keys.

Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues with the turtle graphics not displaying:

    Ensure you're running the script in a local environment (e.g., your computer) rather than a cloud environment like GitHub Codespaces.
    Check Python installation to confirm turtle and tkinter are properly installed. They typically come with Python, but you may need to enable them in certain installations.
